MaterialUI is a UI kit for Unity that follows Google's official Material Design guidelines.

***NOTICE:*** As of May 2015, MaterialUI has been moved to a private repo, where it will <b>continue to be worked on and have features added</b>, in preperation for an official release on the Unity Asset Store. I'd like to thank all who have showed enthusiasm in the project, and hope that they check it out once it's released. This repo is now depricated, and will be removed once the first official release is on the Asset Store.
